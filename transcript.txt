hey guys Paul warberg back here in Utah today if you're curious behind me that is the Provo River one of the Premier fly fishing rivers in the United States doing a little fishing today but I figured while I wait for the fish to rise why not talk a little bit about the Russian economy what I want to talk about today is how vulnerable the Russian economy is and I want to do that by introducing and examining this phrase and this idea modern Russia is not the Soviet Union it's much worse the reason I introduced things this way is because lately there has been a lot of talk about what's going on in the Russian economy for good reason there's a lot of compelling things going on over there right now Russia has a very high interest rate at 21% and Russia is running a budget deficit which for Russia is a much bigger deal than for example the United States running a budget deficit because the United States and Europe still has people willing to lend to them even when they are running a deficit while Russia on the other hand does not have people willing to lend to them I've discussed this in depth in other videos but the point is Russia is finding themselves in a very economically vulnerable position where if things go wrong or things rather continue to go wrong they very realistically could find themselves in a state of econ economic collapse however when I say things like that that Russia could have an economic collapse a lot of people automatically assume that that's not realistic or that's not possible I've explained this a little bit in my previous video where I talked about our psychology kind of prevents us from thinking that drastic things can happen today even when those things have happened over and over throughout history and in my previous video I introduced that con Concept in relation to rebellions today I want to introduce that Concept in relation to economic collapse so going back then to that phrase that I introduced modern Russia is not the Soviet Union it's much worse the reason I introduced that phrase is because everybody knows that the Soviet Union collapsed what a lot of people don't know is that the Soviet Union collapsed due to to some of the same fundamental economic principles that we see in play in modern Russia Today and the point is that if those things could bring down the Soviet Union which I'll demonstrate was much more powerful than modern Russia is there is absolutely no logical reason to assume that it couldn't happen again and if we think it can't happen again it's because we've either failed to study history or we have failed to appreciate the fact that history is actually real so let me draw a couple of connections part of the reason that the Russian economy is doing so poorly right now well most of the reason is obviously because of their war against Ukraine which is siphoning off a lot of their economic resources another part is due to sanctions that have been placed on Russia because of the war against Ukraine where Russia has not been able to trade freely on the international markets and even though they have still been able to sell a lot of their oil they have not been able to sell it at a price that they are used to at profit margins that they are used to altogether what this is doing is that it is Raising costs for Russia at precisely the moment that their revenues are cratering they need a lot more money and there's a lot less it to go around so that's level setting the situation in Russia today and now let's compare that to the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union collapsed a big reason was because they had this war in Afghanistan that went on longer than they expected it cost more than they expected in both financial terms but also in terms of the societal cost and the way that it fractured relationships back at home at the same time part of the reason the Soviet Union collapsed was because while all of this was going on the Soviet Union saw their oil revenues crer the Soviet Union of course was an economy that was highly dependent on oil revenues to profit itself up I've made an entire video analyzing that already where we see that when oil prices were really high the Soviet Union seemed to be doing very good and it was actually seen as somewhat of an economic Miracle where people were touting it as superior to the capitalist West because they made so much progress so quickly but of course what happened was as soon as Global oil prices changed because the Soviet Union Union was so dependent on those their economy couldn't keep up and these things sort of worked together and caused the Soviet Union to collapse basically what it came down to is the Soviet Union was overextended and they had a resource dependency just as modern Russia does today but of course the Soviet Union had a lot more actually working in its favor than modern Russia does there were a few differences between the Soviet economy in the modern Russian economy that a lot of people aren't thinking about that make modern Russia to the careful eye look especially vulnerable so first when it comes to the energy Revenue the Soviet Union had an advantage that modern Russia no longer has where their ability to extract and deliver oil was actually better comparatively for the time than Russia's ability to do so today and that's because in Russia the way that the oil deposits and the gas deposits are is that they're in several different areas and while Russia has some of the biggest natural resource deposits on the planet most of those natural resource deposits are located in very hostile regions Siberia the Arctic Ocean on paper it makes Russia look very rich but from a practical standpoint it's very hard to extract that at a level where you can turn a profit the Soviet Union to make their oil revenues focused instead on other oil fields more to the western part of Russia that were much more temperate in terms of climate and much closer to civilization these oil fields were around the Caucasus uh if you don't know where that is look around the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea on the map and you will see Georgia and around there is where a lot of the most profitable Soviet oil fues were because I've already said the climate was a little bit more temporate but also because these were thousands of kilometers closer than Siberia is to the places that Russia delivered their energy to however because these were the premier oil fields with much lower Transportation costs and much lower extraction costs they were also the oil fields that for obvious reasons got exploited first and now today many of these oil fields are running dry where production has really slowed and it's sort of being rationed to try to prevent them from running completely out and Russia is increasingly now having to rely on more expensive energy fields and harder to reach places and I've done other videos about how in order to make this happen Russia has to build a lot of infrastructure that makes them very vulnerable especially if production ever stops because pipelines can freeze up and then the whole pipeline has to be replaced and so here we see the Soviet Union collapsed when oil revenues tanked even though they had oil production advantages that modern Russia can no longer realize to the same degree strike one for modern Russia the Soviet Union of course also had other massive advantages over modern Russia though and that comes to the lines on the maps the Soviet Union of course was not modern Russia because the Soviet Union was a union that included many nations that are now part of Europe in particular of course the Baltic states but also Ukraine at the time the Soviet Union experienced an economic collapse they could utilize the entire economy of Ukraine to help Shore up their lost oil revenues their lost energy revenues but now today of course the situation is is exactly the opposite instead of being able to use the economies of the satellite states to help support the overall National economy Russia is at war with one of the former satellite States in Ukraine which is what is causing their cost to be so high in the first place strike two for modern Russia so what we see from all of this is that modern Russia is actually in a more vulnerable economic State than the Soviet Union was in when they did indeed collapse now that does not mean that modern Russia will collapse but that means that it is very logical to see that as a genuine possibility and anyone who says that it's not possible or acts like it's just wishful thinking simply does not know their history now all of this said there is a wild card that today is different than it was around around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union which is modern China modern China of course has gone from being a very Backwater economy to one of the largest economies in the world very quickly and China of course sits more in Russia's corner of the geopolitical fence and so the question we have to ask is do the benefits that China is providing to Modern Russia outweigh the disadvantages that modern Russia has against the Soviet Union and the answer to that question of course is no a lot of people have touted how Russia has been able to make up lost energy revenues by selling to India and China instead that's just simply not true it's been able to make up some of its lost energy revenues but a lot of that has been sold at a massive discount and as Russia has tried to expand infrastructure to allow them to deliver more energy to China through Pipelines from Siberia into China those projects have gone nowhere because China is basically saying we don't want to become dependent on Russian gas unless we're getting it at a price that is basically lower than Russia's production price or very close to Russia's production price now of course in addition to all of this there is another new development that's hard to quantify but that will have a meaningful impact which is has just started happening over the past week or so where we have seen Russia's Shadow Fleet begin to sink in the Black Sea this is the fleet that Russia has been of course using to prop up their oil revenues as much as they can which already has been insufficient and now this Fleet is sinking and that's for a very particular reason this Shadow Fleet is old decrepit ships that are not ocean worthy and shouldn't be being used period these ships are difficult if not impossible to ensure for reasons that we can now see very obviously and Russia has been using these to fill the economic holes much like they've been using Soviet era gear from scrapyards to fill their military holes in the front line and predictably these ships are now sinking so Russia's economic decline rather than getting better is only likely to accelerate and to continue getting worse and worse as the war in Ukraine continues to go on and as the fundamental problems with the Russian economy remain unaddressed and unresolved and what we will see is that this old decrepit equipment is only going to Decay at a rate that is faster and faster making the problems accelerate faster and faster by the way this doesn't just apply to Russia's Shadow Fleet of tankers that is a very big headline grabbing example of what we're seeing on a smaller scale all across Russia where Russia is dependent on older and older equipment to continue running their economy their factories their energy infrastructure because they rely on Western parts and Western experts to help keep those things running their stock of Parts is running lower and lower and across their economy we can expect to again see a further accelerated decline where that will end hard to say but it's obviously not going anywhere good for Russia right now I have an entire other video examining this in much more depth that you can check out but before you go can I ask you a quick favor if you enjoyed this video
